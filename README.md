CSS Styling Approach

- CSS is written in a clean and modular way  
- Uses media queries to handle different screen sizes (including 375x667 specifically)  
- Supports dark mode using `prefers-color-scheme` media feature  
- Smooth transitions applied to buttons, links, and cards using `transition` properties  
- Fonts, spacing, and colors chosen for a modern, elegant look  
- Class names are meaningful and grouped by section for readability

Responsive Design
